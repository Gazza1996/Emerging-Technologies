## 5. Digit recognition notebook
A jupyter notebook explaining how the above Python script works and discussing its performance.

## How to run
These are a mix between python and jupyter notebook.

Python must be installed on your machine in order to run any of theae files. You can download python from [here](https://www.python.org/).

Once Python is installed you must run the following command in the cmd prompt

>pip install jupyter

You can clone down this repo following this and once you have you can navigate to the folder directory and run the following command

>jupyter notebook

It will load for a few seconds and a tab in chrome should open up and have the folder appear and you will be able to run all the files in the directory.


In order to run the python script in folder number 4 you must navigate to the folder from the cloned directory and perform the following command,

>python digitrec.py

It will run in the cmd prompt and will then display the image in a paint format and be saved in the folder directory as a PNG file.
